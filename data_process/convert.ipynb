The cash flow after taxes is given as $2,000,000. The effective federal tax rate is 35%, and the state tax rate is 4.5%. \\n\\nFirst, we need to calculate the total tax rate. The combined tax rate can be calculated as follows:\\n\\n1. Calculate the effective tax rate:\\n   - Federal tax: 35%\\n   - State tax: 4.5%\\n   - Total effective tax rate = 35% + 4.5% - (35% * 4.5%) = 35% + 4.5% - 1.575% = 37.925%\\n\\nNext, we need to account for the tax-deductible depreciation of $1,000,000. This means that the cash flow before taxes will be higher than the cash flow after taxes due to the depreciation deduction.\\n\\nThe formula to find cash flow before taxes (CFBT) from cash flow after taxes (CFA) is:\\n\\\\[ CFBT = CFA + Taxes \\\\]\\nWhere:\\n\\\\[ Taxes = CFBT \\\\times \\\\text{Total Effective Tax Rate} \\\\]\\n\\nHowever, we can also express it as:\\n\\\\[ CFBT = CFA / (1 - \\\\text{Total Effective Tax Rate}) + \\\\text{Depreciation} \\\\]\\n\\nUsing the cash flow after taxes of $2,000,000, we can rearrange the equation to find CFBT.\\n\\nThis problem requires moderate reasoning skills to understand tax calculations and the impact of depreciation on cash flow. It is not overly complex but does require a good grasp of financial concepts.\\n\\nReasoning score: 3\",\n",
